# To-Do Application CI/CD Design

## CI/CD Architecture Overview

The CI/CD pipeline for the To-Do Application is designed to ensure efficient development, testing, and deployment workflows. Below is a detailed explanation of the CI/CD design diagram.

### Components and Flow

1. **Source Code Management**
   - GitHub repository hosting both frontend and backend code
   - Feature branch workflow with protected main branch
   - Pull request-based code review process

2. **CI Pipeline (Jenkins)**
   - Triggered on pull requests and main branch commits
   - Parallel build pipelines for frontend and backend
   - Stages:
     - Code checkout
     - Dependencies installation
     - Unit testing
     - Code quality analysis
     - Docker image building
     - Image security scanning
     - Image pushing to registry

3. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Terraform for provisioning:
     - Kubernetes cluster
     - Network resources
     - Storage resources
   - Ansible for:
     - Node configuration
     - Security hardening
     - Monitoring setup

4. **Deployment Environment**
   - Kubernetes cluster running:
     - Frontend container (React)
     - Backend container (Node.js)
     - Database service
   - Container networking:
     - Internal service communication via k8s services
     - Ingress controller for external access
     - Network policies for security

### Application Components Communication

1. **Frontend Container**
   - Exposed via Kubernetes Ingress
   - Communicates with backend via internal service

2. **Backend Container**
   - Internal service only
   - Handles API requests from frontend
   - Connects to database service

3. **Database**
   - Internal stateful service
   - Persistent volume for data storage
   - Accessible only by backend service

## Implementation Notes

- Use GitOps practices for Kubernetes deployments
- Implement automated rollback capabilities
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Configure auto-scaling based on load
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
